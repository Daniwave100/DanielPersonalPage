                <p>I am a Computer Science major at Syracuse University. My academic journey is supplemented by hands-on experience at DARPA, where I contribute to the development of AI solutions to combat misinformation in digital media. With expertise in programming and AI model development, I am actively seeking to apply and expand my skills through real-world projects while making meaningful contributions to every opportunity that comes my way.</p>
                <p>I am also an Army ROTC Cadet and a soldier in the New York Army National Guard. I am currently honing my leadership and teamwork abilities, with the ultimate goal of one day serving as a Cyber Warfare Officer in the Army National Guard.</p>
